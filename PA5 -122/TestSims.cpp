//The general program flow is as follows :
//
//Generate a random number between 1 – 5 and 3 – 8 for expressand normal lanes, respectively.This represents the arrival time of the first customer into each lane.Set the variable for total time elapsed to 0.
//As customers arrive into each line, randomly generate a service time for each.Start processing the customers in the lanes based on service time.Randomly generate the arrival time of the next customer into each line.Elapsed time should be updated by one unit.
//As each minute elapses, a new customer may arriveand /or another customer may be done checking out.Display the appropriate messages as described above.
//For every 10 minutes, print out the entire queue for each line
//Repeat steps 2 through 4 for n minutes of simulation.
